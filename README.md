 Dog-Breed-Classification:
 
 Dog Breed Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks.
 
 Project Overview:
 
 In this project, I built a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can identify the breed of the dog from the image provided to it.
 I have used 2 CNN models for this project. 
 
 First CNN model is a binary classifier that can identify whether the given image is dog or not. If the given image contains dog, the image 
 will be forwarded to the second classifier. If the image doesn't contain dog it notifies user that dog is not found in the image.
 
 Second CNN model is multi class classifier (133 classes(dog breeds)), this classifier identify the breed of the dog.
